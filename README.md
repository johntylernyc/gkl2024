Added additional weighting for player consistency and age and took some liberties with how I decided the player pool, league averages, etc. 

GKL 2024 Retro Notes: 

* Need to have expected value in the the spreadsheet tool / summary area
* Consolidate tabs between offence and pitching in spreadsheet tool so you don’t have to toggle back and forth to enter player names / draft results 
* I didn’t leave enough time to analyse the projections so you lacked a draft strategy. And I was still setting positional budgets at the beginning of the staff. Running the model is only as good as the time you spend interpreting it. And I didn’t have a great sense of the depth at any given position or where I needed to be a bit more aggressive. Relied mostly on past draft experience.
* A lot of guys with relatively average stats were highly ranked / valued. Re-evaluate the modifiers on age, consistency (especially for platoon guys this seems to have overstated value).  I think this is likely due to the way I normalised ratio stats to control for variation in the number of at bats (platoon guys were over-valued, potentially as a result). 
* I think the model was a bit too retrospective with a last 3-year weight in that post-prime players would’ve just had their three best seasons as input. E.g., peak seasons age 29,30,31 the players that are 32,33 look better / project better when we know those are likely decline seasons. This creates the potential for over-valuation. Should analyse the projected values a bit closer and apply a more steep age discount in next year’s model.
